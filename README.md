# Fitness Tracker
## CPSC 210 Term Project
The personal project that I am going to design this term is a fitness tracker. 
The fitness tracker tracks the daily exercises that users complete in a day, such as how many steps or how many kilometers the user completes in a day, and it can log workouts with guided routines. It also allows users to record the daily fitness goals that the user aims for. Furthermore, it allows users to track their daily macro-nutrient consumption and allows users to set goals for *weight gain*, *weight loss*, *protein consumption*, and other nutrition goals. 

This fitness tracker is designed for beginners who wants to get into fitness and start tracking their fitness progress and 
have a clear idea of their fitness goals. It is also a great platform for anyone who wants a structured fitness plan.

I am interested in this project because I enjoy exercising and doing 
workouts to keep myself in shape. However, I tend to find myself struggling with tracking the exercises I need 
to complete, and the amount of protein I need to consume. Building this project helps people like me to have an
organized tracker that keeps everything in order and shows what exercise I need to complete to reach my physique goal.
